              ``SUBMISSION TO QUESTION ABOVE.``: ###{processed_file}###,
              ``Verify submission against rubric included in knowledge file prior to grading.

              IMPORTANT: Respond with ONLY a valid JSON object in this exact format:
              {{
                "points": <number>,
                "comments": "<string>"

    # Generate structured evaluation criteria
    prompt = f"""
    Assignment question: {question}
    Total marks: {possible_points}
    Rubric: {rubric}

    Create a deduction plan based on the rubric. Each criterion should have
    a description and a single numeric deduction value.
    """
