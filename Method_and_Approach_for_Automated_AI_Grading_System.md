# Method and Approach for Automated AI Grading System

## Abstract

This document presents a comprehensive methodology for implementing an automated grading system using Artificial Intelligence (AI) models, specifically Large Language Models (LLMs). The system employs three distinct methodologies (M1, M4, and M5) to evaluate programming assignments, providing consistent, detailed, and unbiased assessment of student submissions. This approach addresses the critical challenges in educational assessment, including time constraints, grading consistency, and the need for detailed feedback in programming education.

## 1. Introduction

### 1.2 Problem Statement

The primary challenge is to develop an automated system that can:

1. Accurately evaluate programming assignments
2. Provide detailed, actionable feedback
3. Maintain consistency across all submissions
4. Scale effectively for large classes
5. Integrate seamlessly with existing educational workflows

### 1.3 Objectives

The main objectives of this research are to:

**Multi-Phase Evaluation Process:**

**Phase 1: Deduction Plan Generation**

```python
def generate_deduction_plan(question, rubric, possible_points):
    """
    Generate structured evaluation criteria based on assignment requirements
    """
    prompt = f"""
    Assignment: {question}
    Rubric: {rubric}
    Total Points: {possible_points}

    Create a detailed deduction plan with:
    - Specific criteria for evaluation
    - Point values for each criterion
    - Deduction amounts for common issues
    """
    return structured_deduction_plan
```

**Phase 2: Criterion-by-Criterion Evaluation**

```python
def evaluate_criterion(submission, criterion, deduction_plan):
    """
    Evaluate submission against specific criterion
    """
    for criterion in deduction_plan.criteria:
        evaluation = assess_criterion(submission, criterion)
        deductions = calculate_deductions(evaluation)
        comments = generate_criterion_feedback(evaluation)
```

**Phase 3: Aggregated Assessment**

```python
def final_grade_calculation(evaluations, deduction_plan):
    """
    Calculate final grade from individual criterion evaluations
    """
    total_deductions = sum(evaluation.deductions for evaluation in evaluations)
    final_score = possible_points - total_deductions
    comprehensive_feedback = synthesize_feedback(evaluations)
```

**Data Models:**

```python
class Criterion(BaseModel):
    description: str
    deduction: float

class DeductionPlan(BaseModel):
    criteria: Dict[str, Criterion]

class EvaluationCriterion(BaseModel):
    deduction: float
    comments: str

### 5.2 Feedback Quality Assessment

#### 5.2.1 Comment Specificity

**M1 Feedback Examples**:

- "Good implementation but missing error handling"
- "Code works correctly but needs better documentation"
- "Minor issues with data preprocessing"

**M4 Feedback Examples**:

- "The linear regression implementation is correct, but you should add try-catch blocks for error handling in the data loading section (lines 15-20)"
- "Your KNN model performs well, but the choice of k=5 could be better justified. Consider using cross-validation to select optimal k"
- "Data preprocessing is appropriate, but you should standardize features before applying KNN as it's distance-based"

**M5 Feedback Examples**:

- "Code Correctness (8/10): Your linear regression implementation correctly uses sklearn's LinearRegression class. However, you're missing input validation for the data loading function. Add checks for file existence and data format validation.
- Data Preprocessing (7/10): You correctly handle missing values with SimpleImputer, but you should also check for outliers using IQR method before scaling. The StandardScaler is applied correctly post-split.
- Model Implementation (9/10): Both models are implemented correctly with appropriate hyperparameters. The train-test split is done before scaling, which is the correct approach.
- Results Analysis (6/10): Your discussion of R² values is good, but you should explain why negative R² values occur and what they indicate about model performance.
- Documentation (8/10): Code is well-commented, but add a markdown cell explaining your methodology and rationale for preprocessing choices."
