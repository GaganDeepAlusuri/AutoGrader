# Automated Grading System (AGS) for Programming Assignments

## Abstract

The Automated Grading System (AGS) aims to revolutionize the grading process in programming education by addressing the extensive time instructors spend on grading and the critical need for timely feedback. Utilizing AI methodologies, particularly Large Language Models (LLMs) like GPT-3.5 and GPT-4, AGS offers a nuanced assessment of programming assignments, considering correctness, coding standards, and logical structuring. The system provides comprehensive feedback, significantly reducing instructors' grading time and enhancing students' learning experiences.

## Introduction

Manual grading in computer science and programming courses faces challenges such as time consumption and delayed feedback. AGS leverages AI and ML to provide efficient, timely, and unbiased grading, integrating seamlessly with existing IT systems like Learning Management Systems (LMS).

## Literature Review

AGS employs AI tools like LLMs with chain-of-thought prompting techniques to improve the grading process, ensuring timely, efficient, and unbiased evaluations. The system is designed to address the lack of a common grading model by offering flexibility, scalability, and security, enhancing educational outcomes through standardized assessment practices.

## Current Challenges

The traditional manual grading system is labor-intensive, error-prone, and subject to bias and inconsistency, limiting the educational process. AGS aims to overcome these challenges by providing an automated, objective grading process.

## Existing Systems

Existing automated grading systems like LetGrade use supervised machine learning for assessment but may lack comprehensive evaluation approaches. AGS stands out by offering detailed feedback based on predefined rubrics and adhering to coding standards.

## Project Overview

AGS utilizes LLMs for a comprehensive evaluation of programming assignments against predefined rubrics. The system automates the grading process, providing immediate feedback and reducing the grading time for instructors.
